# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: A conditional statement is an "if", "else if", or "else" command. Where the data following the "if" will either be true or false. True will lead to a certain return while false will usally result in the "else" command or input being returned. "Else" being the catch-all. While "else-if" is a way to insert and additional "if" or potentially true statement. 

Researched answer: Oof released the above was for the example but I already typed all that haha. 

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git - Local Server (Your computer) // Github however is a remote server which is basically online, or on the website itself. 

Researched answer: Global information tracker, or Godd**n Idiotic truckoad of Sh*t depending on the day and the instance. Git is a form of technology completley independent from any other coding languge or computer operating system. Created in 2005 by the same creator of the Linux operating system. While github however, is an online platform used to share and store code. Often used by developers and coders to share, compare, and work on various projects, lines of code, and applications. An all around user/coder friendly platform meant to make to proccess og collaborating easier. 


2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: An array's index is the numbered property of each character in an arrays, starting at 0 and counting up accocrdingly. While an array's value is a reflection of it's data type (number, boolean, etc)

Researched answer: The "index" is used to identify the location in an array or of the array itself returned as a numerical value. While the value of an array is identified by the content, or data held within the array and not the position of the arrays or it's content. 

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Array's are muiltple pieces of infromation stored within a line of code, that can be identified using the index for the specific piece of info/data. While strings are essentially any data type or piece of information stored between two quotations marks, which will ultimatley result in the data type being read, or returned as a "string" and only a "string". Not it's true data type or value. They both share the concept of identifying individal items within them via indexing said items. They differ via their return value by nature. An array can return an number or boolean value. However a string will always return a string; unless altered using a different command like ".length". 

Researched answer: Arrays are capable of containing any data type, while strings will return null for unreadable data types. An array is usually a collection of data from a single data type, while a string it identified as a collection of characters. They both contain "data", however a string will not return an actual data type; but instead another string. While an array has the ability to return any data type, depending on the data input. 

4. STRETCH: What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?

Researched answer:
Inheritance,polymorphism,abstraction,encapsulation.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Higher Order Functions: 
A tool used for iteration, higher order functions is a JS built in method that takes in a function as an argument. Designed for array's, the function passed as an argument will execute once for every item in the array.

2. Jest: Framework for testing JS. Made up of snippets of code called dependencies. 

3. Objects: A collection of key:value pairs, or a combination of data type symbols and data types accepted by JS.
